About Tile
==========

Tile is a :abbr:`Domain-Specific Language (DSL)` (DSL) that can 
be used to describe tensor-based operations in a clean and 
simple format.  

.. TODO add more spec detail here. 

About Stripe
------------

Written in the Tile language, ``Stripe`` is a polyhedral 
:abbr:`Intermediate Representation (IR)`, or *IR*, that is highly 
amenable to optimization. Stripe is currently a work-in-progress, 
and features are under development include:   

* Arbitrary tensorization

* Affine vertical fusion

* Arbitrarily complex memory hierarchry

* Heterogenous compute topologies

* Detailed performance and cost estimates
